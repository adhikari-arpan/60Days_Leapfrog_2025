## What Is CORS?

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a security feature built into web browsers. It governs how web applications running on one domain can request resources from a different domain, protecting users from potential security threats like data theft or unauthorized actions.

## Why Does CORS Matter in Web Security?

- **Prevents Unauthorized Access:** CORS ensures that only trusted domains can interact with your server's resources, mitigating the risk of cross-origin attacks.
- **Protects Sensitive Data:** Without CORS policies, websites could freely access each other's resources, exposing user data to attackers.
- **Enforces Security Standards:** CORS is crucial for adhering to strict browser and industry security measures.

## How Do Browsers Handle Cross-Origin Requests?

When your web application tries to fetch data from another domain:

- **Browser Sends a CORS Request:** The browser includes an `Origin` header to indicate the requesting domain.
- **Server Responds with CORS Headers:** If the server allows the request, it responds with headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
- **Allowed Domain:** If the requesting domain matches the allowed list, the browser provides access; otherwise, it blocks the response.

## CORS at a Glance

| Aspect              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What it does        | Controls which domains can access your serverâ€™s resources                   |
| Handled by          | Browsers and web servers in coordination                                    |
| Key HTTP headers    | `Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, etc.|
| Security benefit    | Protects against cross-origin attacks and data leaks                        |


- **CORS is essential for modern web security**
- Browsers enforce CORS policies before sharing resources across sites
- Correct CORS settings protect data and ensure trusted interactions
