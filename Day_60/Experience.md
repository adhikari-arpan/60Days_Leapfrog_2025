Over the course of these **60 days 🚀**, I went on an exciting journey of learning and building — starting from **React ⚛️**, diving deeper into **Node.js 🟩**, and exploring **Express 🚂** and **MongoDB 🍃**. Through this challenge, I was able to learn the complete **MERN stack 💻** from scratch, gaining both frontend and backend skills. What started as just a challenge soon turned into a daily habit of consistency and growth. This was my **second 60-day learning challenge with Leapfrog 🐸**, and it once again helped me stay focused, disciplined, and motivated. Huge thanks to **Leapfrog** for this amazing initiative 💚 — I can’t wait to bring all I’ve learned into real-world projects 🔥! I will be immediately be starting on my new project with everything I have learned from these 60 Days. 😋🔥
