# Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side.

## What is Node.js?

- **JavaScript Runtime:** Allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser, on the server.
- **Built on V8 Engine:** Uses Google Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine for fast code execution.
- **Open Source & Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.
- **Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009**.

## Core Concepts

- **Single-Threaded, Event-Driven Architecture:**
  - Uses a single thread with an event loop to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently.
  - Avoids blocking operations, making it highly scalable and lightweight.

- **Asynchronous Programming:**
  - Non-blocking I/O; Node.js can handle other tasks while waiting for operations (like file reads or database queries) to complete.
  - Enables handling thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

- **Modules:**
  - Code is organized into reusable modules.
  - Built-in modules include `fs` (file system), `http` (web server), `path`, `os`, and `events`.
  - Use `require()` to import modules.
  - Node Package Manager (NPM) provides access to a vast ecosystem of third-party modules.

- **NPM (Node Package Manager):**
  - Manages project dependencies and scripts.
  - Install packages using `npm install `.

- **Event Loop:**
  - Manages asynchronous tasks and callbacks, enabling non-blocking operations.
  - Handles tasks in a queue, processing them as resources become available.

## Key Features

- **Very Fast:** Compiles JavaScript to machine code for high performance.
- **Highly Scalable:** Handles many connections with minimal resources.
- **No Buffering:** Outputs data in chunks, not as buffered data.
- **Rich Standard Library:** Includes modules for networking, file system, streams, and more.
- **License:** Released under the MIT license.

## Typical Use Cases

- Real-time applications (chat, gaming, collaboration tools).
- APIs and microservices.
- Data streaming applications.
- Command-line tools.
- Server-side web applications.

## Advantages

- **Unified Language:** Frontend and backend can both use JavaScript, reducing context switching for developers.
- **Large Ecosystem:** Access to thousands of open-source packages via NPM.
- **Modern JavaScript Support:** Can use latest ECMAScript features without waiting for browser adoption.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Node.js:** Download from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Check Installation:**
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
3. **Create and Run Applications:** Use built-in modules and NPM packages to build servers, APIs, and more.
