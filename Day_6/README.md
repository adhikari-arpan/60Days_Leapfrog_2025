# React Notes: Virtual DOM, Fiber, and Reconciliation

---

## Virtual DOM

- **Definition:**  
  The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. It enables React to efficiently update user interfaces by calculating the minimal set of changes needed, rather than updating the entire DOM directly.

- **Working:**  
  1. When a componentâ€™s state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree (a plain JavaScript object structure mirroring the real DOM).
  2. React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a diffing algorithm.
  3. Only the parts of the real DOM that have changed are updated, minimizing direct DOM manipulations.

- **Benefits:**  
  - Improves performance by reducing unnecessary DOM updates.
  - Makes UI updates more predictable and easier to manage.
  - Developers can focus on describing the desired UI state; React handles the updates.

- **Example:**  
  When a button click updates a text, only the changed text node in the DOM is updated, not the entire UI.

## Reconciliation

- **Definition:**  
  Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM to match the latest state of a component. It determines the most efficient way to apply changes from the Virtual DOM to the real DOM.

- **How It Works:**  
  1. When state or props change, React generates a new Virtual DOM tree.
  2. React uses a diffing algorithm to compare the new tree with the previous one.
  3. It identifies what has changed (added, removed, or updated nodes).
  4. React updates only those parts of the real DOM, minimizing performance overhead.

- **Key Points:**  
  - Uses keys to track elements in lists for efficient updates.
  - Avoids unnecessary re-renders by comparing props and state.

## Fiber Architecture

- **Definition:**  
  Fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm introduced in React v16. It enables React to split rendering work into small units, prioritize updates, and pause/resume work as needed.

- **Why Fiber?**  
  - The old stack-based reconciler was synchronous and could block the main thread, leading to dropped frames and sluggish UI, especially for complex updates.
  - Fiber allows React to break rendering into units of work and spread them across multiple frames, improving responsiveness.

- **How Fiber Works:**  
  - Each fiber node represents a unit of work and is implemented as a linked list with pointers to child, sibling, and parent nodes.
  - React traverses the fiber tree in a depth-first manner, pausing and resuming as necessary to maintain smooth UI updates.
  - Supports features like concurrency, prioritization, and error boundaries.

- **Benefits:**  
  - Smoother animations and user interactions.
  - Ability to prioritize urgent updates (e.g., user input) over less critical ones (e.g., data fetching).
  - Enables advanced features like Suspense and concurrent rendering.
