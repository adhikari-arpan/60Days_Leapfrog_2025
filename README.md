# #60DaysOfLearning2025 🚀

Welcome to my #60DaysOfLearning2025 journey!  
This repository documents my daily progress as I take on the 60 Days of Learning challenge organized by [Leapfrog Technology](https://twitter.com/lftechnology). Each day, I’ll be sharing code, notes, and insights as I dive deeper into tech topics that spark my curiosity. 🌱

## 📅 Challenge Overview

- **Duration:** 60 Days (June 1, 2025 – July 30, 2025)
- **Goal:** Learn something new in tech every day and share my progress publicly.
- **Format:** Each day’s work is organized in a separate folder (e.g., `Day_1`, `Day_2`, ...). For days with combined learnings, folders are named as `Day_3,4`, etc.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```

## 🏆 My Commitment

- **Daily Learning:** I will learn and share something new every day for 60 days.
- **Public Sharing:** I’ll tweet my learnings daily, tagging [@lftechnology](https://twitter.com/lftechnology) and using the hashtags:  
  `#LSPPDay{n} #60DaysOfLearning2025 #LearningWithLeapfrog`
- **Consistency:** I aim to post every day and fill out the daily log form as required.
